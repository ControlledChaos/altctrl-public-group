Alternative Public Group Control
================================

Experimental plugin to give more "control" to group admins on their public group. Public groups can become a bit more "protected" and can require a user :
- to join the group to be able to see all areas of the group
- to send a membership request to be able to join the group

Group Admins can create a custom group's front page to inform a "not yet" member about their group. They can also control the group's components that will be displayed to "non members".

You can watch a demo of it [here](https://vimeo.com/98253453)
