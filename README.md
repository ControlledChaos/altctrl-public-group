# Alternative Public Group Control

Adds a more granular visibility control to your BuddyPress Public groups. Public Groups can require the user to request a membership or be invited to join them.

The Administrator can restrict the Group Creation to these Public groups.

Group Admins can create a custom group's front page to inform a "not yet" member about their group. They can also control the group's components that will be displayed to "non members".


## Required Configurations

+ WordPress 4.8+
+ BuddyPress 2.9+


## Installation

+ Before activating the plugin, make sure all the files of the plugin are located in `/wp-content/plugins/altctrl-public-group`.
